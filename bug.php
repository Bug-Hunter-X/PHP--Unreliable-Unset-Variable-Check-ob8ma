This code uses a non-standard way to check if a variable is set.  It relies on the fact that an unset variable evaluates to false in a boolean context, but this is not reliable and can lead to unexpected behavior.  Specifically, a variable that is set to 0 or an empty string will also evaluate to false, leading to errors.

```php
if (!$myVariable) {
  //This will also execute if $myVariable is 0 or ""
  echo "Variable is not set";
}
```
